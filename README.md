# Sine Fortress
Sine Fortress is a Team Fortress 2 Sourcemod set in the 90's with more variety in environments, themes, and two new classes. Existing classes and their roles will stay mostly the same but will have their own additions with new weapons, and the additional classes focused on filling new roles and niches over recreating existing sub-classes and gameplay styles present in Live TF2. 

Aesthetically, Sine Fortress wants to follow the corporate themes of TF2, albeit moving away from the heavy focus on dust bowls and gravel pits. We want to explore the new kinds of companies that can exist in a 90's era interpretation of TF2, focusing on more urban and corporate environments. Respawn Rooms are no longer generic locker rooms and take inspiration from furnished breakrooms while battles take place in urban areas inspired by places like New York and New Jersey.

On the creation side of things, we want to provide tools and assets for mapmakers to create maps unique to Sine, allowing gameplay and story-telling possibilities that cannot be realized in Live TF2 without significant compromise with our RGB team color system, allowing level designers to experiment more with the color composition and theming of their levels.
